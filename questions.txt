What functionality is added when a class C (e.g. Parts) includes the line `extend Forwardable`?

1) Class C acquires some new methods, specifically those listed in the `def_delegators` statement.
2) Class C can now be used as a delegate within another class.
3) More or less the same as if class C was derived from class Array, for example: class C < Array

A 'factory' is:

1) Any variable or class or method can be called factory, it's not a special name
2) Factory is the name of a pattern, the 'factory pattern' and denotes a class whose sole job is to create other classes
3) Factory is a fairly advanced feature in the Ruby language which can also be found in other languages

In Ruby, the Openstruct and Struct classes do:
1) The same thing; OpenStruct was added into Ruby when it was made more general
2) Struct is a core part of the Ruby language; OpenStruct is just a gem that does something different
3) Struct and OpenStruct are both in the core Ruby library and solve similar problems.

Composition vs. Inheritence:
1) Are alternative design approaches which solve essentially the same problem. Everything you can do with one, you can do with the other
2) Composition is when a class is designed to need another class to provide it's full functionality. When Inheritence and Composition can both be used to solve a problem, prefer Composition every time.
3) Two fundamental Object Oriented design patterns, which are important and applicable in different situations. They are not the same thing.
