* Finish everything under nT 0.4 and before.  Do the work in your portfolio, submit it to github. <%= team_deliverable "Also zip together your directory and post it to latte."%>. **GRADED FOR PARTICIPATION ONLY**

#### Discussion about homework reading/viewing

#### Review: Achieving Scale
* Measuring performance:
  * How many Xs per second?
  * and/orhow long does it take to Y?
* Analysis
  * Instrumentation (basically logging)
  * Deep thought
  * Identify the bottle neck
* Action
  * Remove the bottle neck
* Remember: One of the cardinal "sins" is optimizing early
  * Instead, optimize based on measurement
  * Discover which parts of your product's features is causing a scaling problem
  * Consider which of your techniques might be brought to bear
