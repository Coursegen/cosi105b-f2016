title: Intro to Scaling
desc: General concepts to help understand scaling and scaling problems
homework: 1) Study in depth [SODDR] Chapter 3, and submit warmup questions in Latte; 2) Continue work on nanoTwitter 0.1, doing the [DBSCHEMA]

<%= homework_hdr %>
1. Read \[SODRR\] Chapter 3. <%= deliverable "Respond to warmup questions from this chapter by 8am" %>
  * This chapter introduces a running example of this book. It is a social feed reader. It's analogous but different from our nanoTwitter. You should get lots of good ideas from this chapter to use in nT.
  * In this chapter you learn what all the database tables (and therefore what the Models are.) Based on what we've covered so far you should be able to follow it.
  * This chapter mentions Rails. Rails is a bigger sort-of-superset of Sinatra. They are both Ruby libraries. In this class we will be using Sinatra (not Rails)
  * Don't get confused: We **are** using ActiveRecord which is a separable Rails library which is also used in Sinatra. It is the "Object Relational Mapper."
  * It is most important that you take the time to understand the overall set of tables, why they exist and how they relate to each other and apply them to the next step of the homework.
1. Read [Architecting Rails as Microservice Applications](http://blog.codeship.com/architecting-rails-apps-as-microservices/?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email)
1. Start your design of nanoTwitter.
  * All nanoTwitter work should happen in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>, directory `/nanotwitter`
  * <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_outline %>: section \[DBSCHEMA\]. Work on the model. Using the same notation that you used in the previous data model schema, lay out the complete schema design for nanoTwitter, including table names, attributes, indicating primary and foreign keys, as well as associations (belongs_to, etc.) You may also provide a neat diagram. <%= team_deliverable "The datamodel as a pdf" %>

#### Discussion
* Let's take a look at some example schemas to see how they are similar and different

<%= include_topic :scaling %>

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
