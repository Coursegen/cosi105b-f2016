<%= homework_hdr %>
* Read \[SODRR\] Chapter 4. This is a hard, conceptual chapter. You will want to come back to it later in the course. <%= deliverable("Find and respond to the warmups in latte") %>
* Work on nT with team
  * <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_outline %> sections: \[UIDESIGN\], \[ROUTES\],  and \[nanoTwitter 0.1\]
  * Team should decide how to divide up the work. There is lots of opportunity for working separately based on your interests and abilities.
  * All work is happening in <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %> directory `/nanotwitter`
  * <%= team_deliverable "nT code for \\[UIDESIGN\\], \\[ROUTES\\],  and \\[nanoTwitter 0.1\\]" %>
