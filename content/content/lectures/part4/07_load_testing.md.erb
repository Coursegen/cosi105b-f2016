1. <%=partbadge %> <%= codebadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **nT 1.0** Complete nt 1.0 as a team (See: <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_outline %>!). Write and submit a brief project update as a pdf. What went well, what were the challenges, and what are the remaining problems. <%= team_deliverable %(nT code for 1.0 in portfolio and github. Submit to Latte the brief project update.) %>
1. **Team** Prepare everything so that we can run Loader.io tests in class so we can all see the results you are getting.

##### Setup

Before we can run a standardized test, we want to get each server to a known state we do the following commands directly from a browser.

* /test/reset - Delete everything and recreate testuser
* /test/seed/u - create "u" new users
* /test/tweets/t - have testuser tweet "t" times
* /test/follow/f - have f users follow testuser

##### Pattern

Ok, now the server is in a known state. Next we want to do three distinct load tests

* / - user tries to simply load up the home page (non-logged in)
* /user/testuser - specifically load "testusers" home page
* /user/testuser/tweet (POST) - have testuser create one tweet

##### Test runs

* Test case 1: u = 100, t = 500, f = 30
* Test case 2: u = 500, t = 500, f = 100
* Test case 3: u = 3000, t = 2000, f = 1000

##### Loader.io Setup for test
