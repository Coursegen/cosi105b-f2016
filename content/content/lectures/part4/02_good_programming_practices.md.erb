1. Study \[POODR\] Chapter 3. This is a difficult chapter. Please give it the focus and concentration necessary. You should do all the examples, by typing them in yourself and getting them to work. Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>. <%= deliverable "Locate and submit \\[POODR\\] Chapter 3 warmups in Latte by 8am on the day of class" %>
1. Read about [Code Smells](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html) and [Code Smell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell) in wikipedia. Don't stop there. Google for Code Smells and find the most important and common ones. Examine your own <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %> and <%= deliverable "Submit a pdf to latte Pointing out two code smells in your own code." %>
1. Begin working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %> in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>, directory `movies-2`. You need to understand the assignment, and **implement the first part, which is the MovieData class and all it's methods.** Think about how you would check that the methods are working correctly. We will review the work in the portfolio so you don't need to put anything into Latte. We will look at some students' solutions in class and do a design review and discussion.

<%= callout("REMINDER", " Your portfolios will be reviewed TODAY for progress.") %>

#### Homework discussion
* Discussion about \[POODR\] Chapter 3
  * Gear and Wheel have several kinds of dependencies. What are they?
  * Why are dependencies bad?
  * How are things improved when (on page 41) wheel becomes an input to the initializer?
  * Why does she keep using the term “messages”?
  * What is dependency direction, how can it be changed, and how do you know which is preferred?
