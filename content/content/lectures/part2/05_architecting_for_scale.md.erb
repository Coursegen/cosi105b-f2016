1. <%= timebadge %> <%= partbadge %> Read \[SODRR\] Chapter 4. This is a hard, conceptual chapter. You will want to come back to it later in the course. <%= deliverable("Find and respond to the warmups in latte") %>
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= codebadge %> Begin work on nanoTwitter 0.2 (<%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_outline %>). This work is all done together as a team. It makes sense to divide up tasks between the team members. All nanoTwitter work, from here on, should happen in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>, directory `/nanotwitter`. nt 0.2 will be due on xxxx.
