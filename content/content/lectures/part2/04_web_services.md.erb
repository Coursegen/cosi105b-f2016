<%= homework_hdr %>
1. <%= codebadge %> Work on nT with team. See: <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_outline %>, nT 0.1. The team should decide how to divide up the work. There is lots of opportunity for working separately based on your interests and abilities. Reminder: All work is happening in <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %> directory `/nanotwitter.` <%= team_deliverable %(nT code for [nanoTwitter 0.1] in portfolio) %>
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= timebadge %> Read this article. It's long but important: [Best Practices for Designing a Pragmatic RESTful API](http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api). <%= deliverable "Locate and respond to the warmups in Latte." %>
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> Examine the nt Web Services (REST) API routes from <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_functionality %>. You will see that the general pattern is laid out, but not all permutations are explained. Evaluate them in the context of this reading. You're welcome to improve them so they follow more pragmatic REST principles. Now, write "REST API Documentation" for the nanoTwitter service api. Look for examples on the web for how web APIs are documented for what you think is a good format. (Here's what twitter does as an example: [Twitter statuses API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/retweets_of_me). Remember that you have to state the url's "syntax" and the format of the input and output data (JSON). Your documentation should be good enough for a programmer who doesn't know anything about your app to properly access the API. <%= team_deliverable "PDF with the API documentation." %>

#### Questionnaire
* 3x5 questions: Bullet Feedback about the course

#### Discussion
* Think about this, then talk to your neighbor, write down answers:
  * What are some of the reasons why a product (like Facebook) would be divided up into "services"? Doing this is sometimes called a service oriented architecture. What is a service? What are some of the motivations for dividing a product into a set of services?
  * HTTP is a protocol used when one computer (the client) has to make a request of another computer (the server). The client makes a request, and the server responds to that request. What are the key parts or elements in the request? What are the key parts of building blocks of the response?
