	* <%= deliverable "Your code plus screencast, in your portfolio, as stated above." %>
1. Form your nanoTwitter teams
  * We have xx students. We should try to have 6 teams of 3 and one team of 4.
  * You will need to find time to work together, so please check teammates schedule and try to pick a time slot before joining together.
  * Here's the [signup spreadsheet for nanoTwitter teams.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16X93LIfQuqAefS5E7Wpawbu7s9I0_sz-3vf7rnHu924/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Put a team name next to your name. Make sure you spell it the exact same way.
  * Stating the obvious: each team name should appear either three or four times.
  * This is a "class participation" homework. 0 If you don't do it. 100 if you do.

#### Discussion
* Discuss homework
  * Let's look at someone's code
  * Demo your code
  * Let's talk about challenges encountered
  * Who is still unsure about the role of a "client library" in a service oriented architecture?
