1.  <%= partbadge %> <%= timebadge %> Read \[SODRR\] Chapter 3. <%= deliverable "Respond to warmup questions from this chapter by 8am" %> This chapter introduces a running example of this book. It is a social feed reader. It's analogous but different from our nanoTwitter. You should get lots of good ideas from this chapter to use in nT. In this chapter you learn what all the database tables (and therefore what the Models are.) Based on what we've covered so far you should be able to follow it. This chapter mentions Rails. Rails is a bigger sort-of-superset of Sinatra. They are both Ruby libraries. In this class we will be using Sinatra (not Rails). Don't get confused: We **are** using ActiveRecord which is a separable Rails library which is also used in Sinatra. It is the "Object Relational Mapper." It is most important that you take the time to understand the overall set of tables, why they exist and how they relate to each other and apply them to the next step of the homework.
1. <%= codebadge %> Continue working on and complete nt 0.1 as a team. See: <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_outline %>. <%= team_deliverable %(nT code for [nanoTwitter 0.1] in portfolio) %>


#### Discussion
* Let's take a look at some example schemas to see how they are similar and different
