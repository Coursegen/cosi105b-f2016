<%= callout("Note for first day of class:", " Each day of class has a page on this web site. The first section of that page is always the homework due on that very day. So in other words, the homework listed here is actually 'pre-work' for day one. We will go over this in a little more detail during class.") %>

1. **Linux Parition**: If you are on Windows, you are required to setup a Linux Partition. Here is why and how: <%= link_to_topic :linux_partition %>
1. **Ruby**: Make sure of your Ruby programming ability. There are plenty of online resources. Here's one: [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html)

#### Introductions
* Introduce Pito, and how I ended up here. Look at: <%= link_to_topic :pitofaq %>
* Why do I do this? My commitment to teaching and student learning. * TAs introduce themselves

#### About this course
* What is this course about and how is it different from the prerequisite [Cosi166b - Capstone in Software Entrepreneurs](http://cosi166b-s2016.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/intro/syllabus.md/)?
* This is version 2 of this course. It has changed about 25% from previous years!
* Heres what you should learn in this course: <%= link_to_background :goals_cosi105 %>

  * What kinds of specific skills will you learn and practice in this course?
  * Could this course change your life?

#### Logistics

<%= callout("NB", " The prime source for this course is this web site itself!")%>

* Here are the <%= link_to_topic :books_cosi105 %>
* Let's take a tour of the web site
* Let's take a tour of [Latte for this course](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/course/view.php?id=6990)

#### Recitatin
<%= callout("NB", " Every Friday (including today!) from 2:00 to 4:50 we have a lab/workshop in Goldsmith 317") %>
* My experience teaching this course is that most of you will need this to be successful.
* There is no lecture. Sometimes there's a hands-on workshop. Other times you work on your projects or homework. Either way we are available to help out (usually it's homework related.)

#### 30 Minute Quick Assignment
* <%= link_to_background :leveling %>

#### Homeworks and Grading
* Yes there is a fair bit of homework
* You are responsible for reading the lecture's page before each class
<%= callout("Student Quote", " \"Pay close attention to this. It's not complicated if you do. Still, almost everyone got it wrong the first few times.\" ") %>
* Some homeworks have explicit deliverables:
	* Will be clearly marked as "deliverable" or "team deliverable"
	* Are numbered, X.Y - X is the lecture number and Y is the homework for this lecture
	* Those are submitted to the appropriate spot in Latte, either as a .pdf (for writing) or as a .zip file
* To help you navigate, there are the following symbols:
  * <%= pdfbadge %>: this symbol reminds you that you are to submit a pdf to latte. Anything else will receive a 40.
  * <%= partbadge %>: this symbol tells you that this assignment is graded as "participation only". You will receive a 100 if you show a good faith effort, without regard to whether your answer is correct. You will receive a zero otherwise
  * <%= timebadge %>: This symbol reminds you that this assignment is due by 8am on the day of class. No late submissions or make ups are accepted.

* The portfolio
	* Where all your programming work has to happen
	* Look carefully at <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
* Here's more information about <%= link_to_background :grading %>

<%= callout("NOTE", " Often there is a concrete deliverable, a blog post, a zip file with code, etc. Those have to be submitted to LATTE") %>

#### Skills Inventory
* **Whether you are officially registered or want to be on the wait list**
* *Really quickly* Fill in [Skills Inventory](https://goo.gl/forms/BQDDhPz0s6d1n9oB2). (This page is protected until the day of class) Obviously this is not graded. The purpose is to help us put together good teams. **Do it now please**

#### Project

* All students will work in teams on their version of <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_outline %>
* We will form teams of exactly 4-5 students. You will be assigned to a team.
* Let's look at what it's like to <%= link_to_topic :working_in_teams %>

#### Next Class
<%= callout("Remember", " Recitation is Friday at 2:00pm and every week, starting today!") %>
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
