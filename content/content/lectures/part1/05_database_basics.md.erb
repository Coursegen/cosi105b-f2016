1. Use what you've practiced in the Tutorial and Chapter 1 and do <%= link_to_topic :pa_sinatra_evite_1 %>. Do the code in your portfolio, creating a new directory. **HEY:** There are still people who don't name the directories correctly. Please name the directory: `sinatra-evite`. Thanks.

#### Report back on the 3x5 feedback

* **Some things that I can and will try and change**
  * get into scalability concepts quicker (2x)
  * dont waste time answering very specific questions from warm-ups, because lack of utility to class at large
  * more focused/organized Friday sessions
  * want to know more about system design concepts and databases
  * More examples when going over complex concepts like servers (2x)

* **Some things that I don't really "buy"**
  * more office hours/fixed office hours for TA outside of class (3)
  * not a fan of cold-calling students

* Other things that are mentioned
  * **General positive:** thinks course is good, course website is helpful (3x); there is a lot of homework, but understand that it is necessary to learn quickly (2x)
  * **Coding:** Wants more book-coding assignments and in-class discussions; More coding assignments that aren’t heavy in grading for more practice without grade pressure; Videos going through the sample code with explanations is very useful
  * **Reading related:** SODDR is slightly outdated and it isn’t as helpful to follow the book; explanation of underlying code in readings is inadequate because it doesn’t really explain what the syntax is doing
  * **Miscellaneous suggestions:** class should be a full-year course; Setup pc for ruby is hard
